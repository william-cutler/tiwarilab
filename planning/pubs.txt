Open-source Artifacts
Besides peer-reviewed research publications, our group also makes our contributions available
as open-source artifacts. Although not required by the publication venues, we make these
artifacts available at the time of the publication of our regular peer-reviewed research
publications. The goal behind making these contributions open-source are threefold: (1)
expedite the research progress as a community, (2) lower the barrier to entry to new fields
(e.g., quantum computing), and (3) promote research reproducibility. Our artifacts are often
one of the largest of their kind, and introduce novel methods and datasets to the community
— consequently, have been downloaded and used by hundreds of researchers around the world.
